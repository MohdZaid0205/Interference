# Interference

This project aims to visualize the behavior of waves and their interference patterns in a simple and interactive way. It serves as an educational tool for understanding wave phenomena, such as constructive and destructive interference.

The current implementation is in **`Python`** using the **`raylib`** library, with plans to transition to **C** for improved performance and flexibility.
